            Procedural programming languages are designed to follow a sequence
            of steps to solve a problem. They use functions or subroutines to
            break down a program into smaller, more manageable parts.
          </td>
          <td>
            Object-oriented programming languages are designed to organize code
            into reusable objects that interact with each other. Objects have
            properties and methods, and can inherit from other objects.
          </td>
          <td>
            Functional programming languages are designed to use mathematical
            functions to solve problems. They treat functions as first-class
            citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned as
            values, and stored in variables.
          </td>
          <td>
            Scripting languages are designed to automate tasks and manipulate
            data. They are usually interpreted, meaning the code is executed on
            the fly, without the need for compilation.

        <tr>
          <td>C, Fortran</td>
          <td>Java, Python</td>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Procedural languages are often used for scientific computing,
            simulations, and systems programming. For example, C is used to
            write operating systems and embedded systems.
          </td>
          <td>
            Object-oriented languages are often used for large-scale software
            development, web applications, and game development. For example,
            Java is used to develop Android apps, and Python is used for machine
            learning and data analysis.
          </td>
          <td>
            Functional languages are often used for academic research, data
            processing, and artificial intelligence. For example, Haskell is
            used for mathematical modeling and verification, and Lisp is used
            for natural language processing and symbolic computation.
          </td>
          <td>
            Scripting languages are often used for web development, system
            administration, and prototyping. For example, JavaScript is used to
            create interactive websites and web applications, and PHP is used to
            create dynamic web pages and manage server-side tasks.
