      <h1>PROGRAMMING SYNTAX</h1>
      <p>
        Programming syntax is like a special set of rules that we have to follow
        to give instructions to the computer. Just like how we have to follow
        certain rules when playing a game or doing a puzzle, we have to follow
        the rules of programming syntax to make sure the computer understands
        what we want it to do. For example, let's say we want to tell the
        computer to add two numbers together. We can't just say "add these two
        numbers" like we would to a friend. We have to use programming syntax,
        which might look something like this: "num1 + num2". The computer
        understands this syntax as an instruction to add the two numbers
        together.
