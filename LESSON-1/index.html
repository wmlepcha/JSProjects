      <h1>WHAT IS PROGRAMMING</h1>
      <p>
        Programming is like giving instructions to a computer. Just like how you
        follow steps to make a cake, a computer follows instructions to do
        something. The instructions you give to a computer are written in a
        special language called a programming language. These instructions are
        called code. When you write code, you use words and symbols that the
        computer can understand. The computer then reads the code and does what
        you told it to do. For example, you could write code that tells the
        computer to add two numbers together. When the computer runs the code,
        it will add the numbers together and give you the result. Programmers
        use code to make all sorts of things like video games, websites, and
        even apps for your phone! Learning to program can be a lot of fun
        because you get to be creative and make things that other people can
        use. It can also be a bit challenging because you have to think
        logically and make sure your instructions are correct. But with practice
        and patience, anyone can learn to program and create amazing things! So,
        you see, programming is not just about typing lines of code. It's about
        creating something that people can interact with and enjoy. And the best
        part is, you can use programming to make anything you can imagine! ðŸ¤©
